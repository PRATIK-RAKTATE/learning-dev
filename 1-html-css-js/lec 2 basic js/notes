Single Threaded js
js runs code line by line on single thread. 

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute one task at a time within its main thread, but it uses asynchronous mechanisms to handle multiple tasks efficiently.

2) Key Points:
Single Execution Thread: Executes one task at a time in a linear sequence.
Event Loop: Manages asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.
Call Stack: Handles synchronous code execution.
Web APIs & Task Queue: Offload asynchronous tasks like I/O operations.
Non-blocking Behavior: Enables smooth execution despite being single-threaded.


languages can be run in multiple thread 
Java
C++
Python
Go
C#
Rust
Kotlin
Ruby
Swift
Scala


4. Garbage collected
any language can manage memory in 3 way

by chatgpt
 Key Types of Memory Management:
Manual Memory Management:

Developers allocate and deallocate memory explicitly.
Used in languages like C and C++.
Automatic Garbage Collection (GC):

The runtime environment automatically frees unused memory.
Used in languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript.
Reference Counting:

Tracks the number of references to an object and deallocates it when no references remain.
Used in Objective-C, Swift, and Python (CPython).

1) Garbage collected
    automatically done by language
    usually no pointer and memory issue
    we cant do memory manegement manually
    eg java js
2) Manual
    we have to allocat and dealocate memory yourself
    can lead to daggling and memory issues
    learning curve is high hence we do memory management
    eg c
3) The rust way 
    Rust has its own model of memory management
    Makes exactly safe to memory manegement

conclusion
js is beginer friendly
ans -> no and yes
    its beginer friendly but has loss of performance overheads.
    bun is trying to solve these issues then js can compete with language like cpp and rust.




Syntax of js
1 variables
    variabls are used to store data. 
    we can declare variables using var,let and const

2) datatypes 
3) funtions
4) operators
5) loops    

Complex data types

Objects
Array of Objects
